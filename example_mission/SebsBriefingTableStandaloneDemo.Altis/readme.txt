This version does not require the server, or any of its players, to have the mod installed. It functions exactly the same as the mod version. Don't have both running at the same time.

Copy & paste the following files & folders into your mission directory:
sebsBriefingTable
description.ext

DO NOT OVERWRITE YOUR MISSION.SQM. IT WILL DELETE YOUR MISSION.

Alternatively, this is a fully functioning mission you can load in the editor to see how to use the functions correctly.
